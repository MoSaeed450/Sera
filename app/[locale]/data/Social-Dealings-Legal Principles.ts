        "text": "That which is lawful is clear and that which is unlawful is clear, and between the two of them are doubtful matters about which many people do not know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor, but he who falls into doubtful matters [eventually] falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah's sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh, which, if it be whole, all the body is whole, and which, if it is diseased, all of [the body] is diseased. Truly, it is the heart.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith confirms that halal and haram are clearly defined by Allah, but some matters are doubtful. The Prophet advised avoiding doubtful matters as they may lead to what is clearly haram. Behavior depends on the state of the heart - when the heart is sound, the body does good deeds and avoids prohibitions. The principle of a danger zone protects Muslims from temptation."

        "text": "I have been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that there is none worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, and until they establish the salah and pay the zakat. And if they do that then they will have gained protection from me for their lives and property, unless [they commit acts that are punishable] in Islam, and their reckoning will be with Allah.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "Jihad's purpose is removing obstacles to Islam's propagation, ensuring freedom of thought and choice, and protecting Muslims from persecution. The 'people' to be fought are those who attack Muslims or prevent Islam's peaceful spread. Anyone who pronounces shahada is protected. The 'right of Islam' includes fighting those who refuse prayer or zakah, and capital punishment for murder, adultery, and apostasy. Hypocrites are not harmed if they appear outwardly Muslim."

        "narrator": "Abu Hurayrah",
        "text": "What I have forbidden for you, avoid. What I have ordered you [to do], do as much of it as you can. For verily, it was only the excessive questioning and their disagreeing with their Prophets that destroyed [the nations] who were before you.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith defines a main principle: avoid all prohibitions without exception, but perform obligations according to your ability. Avoidance of haram takes priority and is more virtuous because there's no allowance for hardship, unlike obligatory duties. The hadith also condemns excessive questioning aimed at argument or theoretical situations, though seeking beneficial knowledge is encouraged."

        "number": 10,
        "narrator": "Abu Hurayrah",
        "text": "Allah the Almighty is Good and accepts only that which is good. And verily Allah has commanded the believers to do that which He has commanded the Messengers. So the Almighty has said: \"O (you) Messengers! Eat of the tayyibat [all kinds of halal (legal) foods], and perform righteous deeds.\" [23:51] and the Almighty has said: \"O you who believe! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you.\" [2:172]",
        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith emphasizes avoiding the unlawful in worldly life and the Hereafter. Allah accepts only pure deeds done sincerely for Him. The Prophet illustrated that one who persists in consuming haram should not expect Allah's aid, and response to his supplication is unlikely until he repents. Consuming lawful food when intending obedience is itself rewarded."

        "source": "At-Tirmidhi & An-Nasai",
        "clarification": "This hadith advocates taqwa and avoiding doubtful matters, emphasizing adherence to what brings reassurance rather than anxiety. The principle of basing actions on certainty also applies to worship - when doubting, count only what you're certain of. Doubt should be dispelled by seeking knowledge, and negative influences replaced with confident adherence to what is evident."

        "source": "At-Tirmidhi",
        "clarification": "This hadith is fundamental for perfecting Islam and refining the soul. Progressing to ihsan requires mindfulness of Allah and proper behavior. Keeping away from what doesn't concern you distances you from doubtful and unlawful matters. This especially applies to guarding the tongue - many sins come from careless speech, so one should restrict words to truth and beneficial matters."

        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith describes a sincere believer who has true faith. It teaches perfecting religion through good manners: consider the outcome of speech before speaking (silence is better unless speech deserves reward), be generous to neighbors (whether near or far, Muslim or non-Muslim), and show hospitality to guests through pleasant treatment and service according to circumstances."

        "text": "I counsel you to have taqwa (fear) of Allah, and to listen and obey [your leader], even if a slave were to become your ameer. Verily he among you who lives long will see great controversy, so you must keep to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the Khulafa ar-Rashideen (the rightly guided caliphs), those who guide to the right way. Cling to it stubbornly [literally: with your molar teeth]. Beware of newly invented matters [in the religion], for verily every bidah (innovation) is misguidance.",
        "source": "Abu Dawud & At-Tirmidhi",
        "clarification": "This forceful admonition emphasizes taqwa as the key to happiness in the Hereafter. Obedience is due to Muslim rulers as long as orders don't involve disobedience to Allah, with patience urged even toward corrupt rulers to avoid civil strife. The Prophet warned of future dissensions and instructed adherence to his sunnah and that of the rightly guided caliphs. Bid'ah (innovation) refers to religious matters without basis in Shariah - the antithesis of sunnah. Every innovation in religion is misguidance leading to the Fire. This doesn't include worldly inventions or public interest rulings within Shariah framework."

        "text": "Verily Allah ta'ala has laid down religious obligations (fara'id), so do not neglect them; and He has set limits, so do not overstep them; and He has forbidden some things, so do not violate them; and He has remained silent about some things, out of compassion for you, not forgetfulness — so do not seek after them.",
        "source": "Ad-Daraqutnee",
        "clarification": "This hadith summarizes the religion into four categories: obligations to be fulfilled, prohibitions to be avoided, limits (hudud) not to be transgressed, and matters Allah remained silent on (out of mercy, not forgetfulness) which should not be probed into. It warns against excessive questioning about undefined matters."

        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "This establishes the obligation to correct wrong (munkar). One must change it with their hand (action) if able, otherwise with their tongue (advice/warning), or at least detest it in their heart, which is the weakest level of faith. It emphasizes active social responsibility to maintain moral standards."

        "source": "Ibn Majah & Al-Bayhaqee",
        "clarification": "This hadith highlights Allah's immense mercy and the ease of Islam. It lifts the sin (but not necessarily the legal consequences, like compensation) for actions done by mistake, out of forgetfulness, or under coercion. It assures believers that they are not held accountable for what is beyond their control."
