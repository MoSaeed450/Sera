        "text": "Actions are (judged) by motives (niyyah), so each man will have what he intended. Thus, he whose migration (hijrah) was to Allah and His Messenger, his migration is to Allah and His Messenger; but he whose migration was for some worldly thing he might gain, or for a wife he might marry, his migration is to that for which he migrated.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith emphasizes that deeds are judged by Allah based on intention, not quantity or appearance. The niyyah (intention) serves two functions: defining the specific worship and distinguishing acts done for Allah from those done for worldly gain. A deed must be done sincerely for Allah alone to be accepted."

        "narrator": "Umar",
        "text": "Islam is that you should testify that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger (ﷺ), that you should perform salah (ritual prayer), pay the zakah, fast during Ramadan, and perform Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (the Ka`bah at Makkah), if you can find a way to it (or find the means for making the journey to it).",
        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith comprehensively describes the religion through three concepts: Islam (outward submission), Iman (inner belief in Allah, angels, books, messengers, Last Day, and predestination), and Ihsan (worshipping Allah as if you see Him). Islam includes visible actions, while Iman involves correct belief proven by actions. Ihsan is the highest degree - acute consciousness of Allah leading to sincerity and precision in deeds."

        "narrator": "Abdullah bin Umar ibn al-Khattab",
        "text": "Islam has been built on five [pillars]: testifying that there is no deity worthy of worship except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah, establishing the salah (prayer), paying the zakat (obligatory charity), making the hajj (pilgrimage) to the House, and fasting in Ramadhan.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "These five pillars are the foundation of Islam - the minimum requirements without which the religion cannot stand. However, Islam is not limited to these five; complete obedience to all of Allah's commands is essential for perfection. The shahada (testimony) is the first building block, followed by prayer, zakah, hajj, and fasting."

        "text": "He who innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not of it will have it rejected (by Allah).",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith warns against innovation (bid'ah) in religious matters. For a deed to be accepted by Allah, it must meet two conditions: sincerity of intention (done for Allah alone) and correctness (done according to Quran and Sunnah). Any innovation in religion is rejected because Allah has already perfected Islam, and adding to it contradicts the Quran."

        "number": 6,
        "narrator": "An-Nu'man ibn Basheer",
        "text": "That which is lawful is clear and that which is unlawful is clear, and between the two of them are doubtful matters about which many people do not know. Thus he who avoids doubtful matters clears himself in regard to his religion and his honor, but he who falls into doubtful matters [eventually] falls into that which is unlawful, like the shepherd who pastures around a sanctuary, all but grazing therein. Truly every king has a sanctuary, and truly Allah's sanctuary is His prohibitions. Truly in the body there is a morsel of flesh, which, if it be whole, all the body is whole, and which, if it is diseased, all of [the body] is diseased. Truly, it is the heart.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith confirms that halal and haram are clearly defined by Allah, but some matters are doubtful. The Prophet advised avoiding doubtful matters as they may lead to what is clearly haram. Behavior depends on the state of the heart - when the heart is sound, the body does good deeds and avoids prohibitions. The principle of a danger zone protects Muslims from temptation."

        "text": "What I have forbidden for you, avoid. What I have ordered you [to do], do as much of it as you can. For verily, it was only the excessive questioning and their disagreeing with their Prophets that destroyed [the nations] who were before you.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith defines a main principle: avoid all prohibitions without exception, but perform obligations according to your ability. Avoidance of haram takes priority and is more virtuous because there's no allowance for hardship, unlike obligatory duties. The hadith also condemns excessive questioning aimed at argument or theoretical situations, though seeking beneficial knowledge is encouraged."

        "number": 10,
        "narrator": "Abu Hurayrah",
        "text": "Allah the Almighty is Good and accepts only that which is good. And verily Allah has commanded the believers to do that which He has commanded the Messengers. So the Almighty has said: \"O (you) Messengers! Eat of the tayyibat [all kinds of halal (legal) foods], and perform righteous deeds.\" [23:51] and the Almighty has said: \"O you who believe! Eat of the lawful things that We have provided you.\" [2:172]",
        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith emphasizes avoiding the unlawful in worldly life and the Hereafter. Allah accepts only pure deeds done sincerely for Him. The Prophet illustrated that one who persists in consuming haram should not expect Allah's aid, and response to his supplication is unlikely until he repents. Consuming lawful food when intending obedience is itself rewarded."

        "source": "At-Tirmidhi & An-Nasai",
        "clarification": "This hadith advocates taqwa and avoiding doubtful matters, emphasizing adherence to what brings reassurance rather than anxiety. The principle of basing actions on certainty also applies to worship - when doubting, count only what you're certain of. Doubt should be dispelled by seeking knowledge, and negative influences replaced with confident adherence to what is evident."

        "text": "Part of the perfection of one's Islam is his leaving that which does not concern him.",
        "source": "At-Tirmidhi",
        "clarification": "This hadith is fundamental for perfecting Islam and refining the soul. Progressing to ihsan requires mindfulness of Allah and proper behavior. Keeping away from what doesn't concern you distances you from doubtful and unlawful matters. This especially applies to guarding the tongue - many sins come from careless speech, so one should restrict words to truth and beneficial matters."

        "number": 15,

        "text": "Let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day speak good, or keep silent; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his neighbour; and let him who believes in Allah and the Last Day be generous to his guest.",
        "source": "Bukhari & Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith describes a sincere believer who has true faith. It teaches perfecting religion through good manners: consider the outcome of speech before speaking (silence is better unless speech deserves reward), be generous to neighbors (whether near or far, Muslim or non-Muslim), and show hospitality to guests through pleasant treatment and service according to circumstances."

        "text": "Say I believe in Allah — and then be steadfast.",
        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "This concise advice includes all meanings of iman and Islam. Being upright means adhering to the straight path laid out by Allah, free from deviation. The basis is tawheed and sincerity - complete obedience to Allah with the knowledge that He alone is your Lord. Evidence of faith is in behavior, and true knowledge of Allah establishes awe, fear, love and hope in the heart."

        "narrator": "Abu Malik al-Harith bin Asim al-Asharee",
        "text": "Purity is half of iman (faith). 'Al-hamdu lillah (praise be to Allah)' fills the scales, and 'subhan-Allah (how far is Allah from every imperfection) and 'Al-hamdulillah (praise be to Allah)' fill that which is between heaven and earth. And the salah (prayer) is a light, and charity is a proof, and patience is illumination, and the Qur'an is a proof either for you or against you. Every person starts his day as a vendor of his soul, either freeing it or causing its ruin.",
        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "Purity includes both physical purification and purity of heart from envy, hatred, and conceit - a significant part of faith. Praising Allah (al-hamdulillah) earns great reward, and adding subhan Allah earns even more. Prayer is light enlightening hearts and showing the straight path. Sadaqah is evidence of faith (hypocrites don't give it). Patience is burning light requiring great effort to control the self. The Quran argues for those who lived by it and against those who ignored it. Each day is a transaction - efforts for Allah bring salvation, efforts for Shaytan bring punishment."

        "narrator": "Abu Dharr al-Ghifaree",
        "text": "O My servants! I have forbidden dhulm (oppression) for Myself, and I have made it forbidden amongst you, so do not oppress one another. O My servants, all of you are astray except those whom I have guided, so seek guidance from Me and I shall guide you. O My servants, all of you are hungry except those whom I have fed, so seek food from Me and I shall feed you. O My servants, all of you are naked except those whom I have clothed, so seek clothing from Me and I shall clothe you. O My servants, you commit sins by day and by night, and I forgive all sins, so seek forgiveness from Me and I shall forgive you. O My servants, you will not attain harming Me so as to harm Me, and you will not attain benefiting Me so as to benefit Me. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all as pious as the most pious heart of any individual amongst you, then this would not increase My Kingdom an iota. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all as wicked as the most wicked heart of any individual amongst you, then this would not decrease My Kingdom an iota. O My servants, if the first of you and the last of you, and the humans of you and the jinn of you, were all to stand together in one place and ask of Me, and I were to give everyone what he requested, then that would not decrease what I Possess, except what is decreased of the ocean when a needle is dipped into it. O My servants, it is but your deeds that I account for you, and then recompense you for. So he who finds good, let him praise Allah, and he who finds other than that, let him blame no one but himself.",
        "source": "Muslim",
        "clarification": "This hadith qudsi covers major aspects of belief and practice. Allah prohibited injustice for Himself and His servants - divine injustice is impossible. All creatures are helpless and dependent on Allah for guidance, provision, and forgiveness. Allah likes supplication and responds to it. Repentance should be continuous as humans inevitably sin. Creatures cannot harm or benefit Allah; righteousness or wickedness affects only their own souls. Even if Allah gave everything requested by all servants, it wouldn't decrease His dominion. Full compensation for deeds comes in the Hereafter. Praise Allah for righteousness; blame only yourself for failure."

Verily he among you who lives long will see great controversy, so you must keep to my Sunnah and to the Sunnah of the Khulafa ar-Rashideen (the rightly guided caliphs), those who guide to the right way. Cling to it stubbornly [literally: with your molar teeth]. Beware of newly invented matters [in the religion], for verily every bidah (innovation) is misguidance.",
        "source": "Abu Dawud & At-Tirmidhi",
        "clarification": "This forceful admonition emphasizes taqwa as the key to happiness in the Hereafter. Obedience is due to Muslim rulers as long as orders don't involve disobedience to Allah, with patience urged even toward corrupt rulers to avoid civil strife. The Prophet warned of future dissensions and instructed adherence to his sunnah and that of the rightly guided caliphs. Bid'ah (innovation) refers to religious matters without basis in Shariah - the antithesis of sunnah. Every innovation in religion is misguidance leading to the Fire. This doesn't include worldly inventions or public interest rulings within Shariah framework."

        "clarification": "This hadith highlights Allah's immense mercy and the ease of Islam. It lifts the sin (but not necessarily the legal consequences, like compensation) for actions done by mistake, out of forgetfulness, or under coercion. It assures believers that they are not held accountable for what is beyond their control."
